## Assumptions I've made:
-When a line is selected and you click 'draw line', the line should be un-selected
-Move should only work when the left-mouse button is held down


## Requirements

#### Make deletion more deterministic

#### Add new Pencil mode

#### Support moving lines

I added a message in the toolbar when the user attempts to move outside the canvas area.
